# Student-Academic-Performance-Analysis
*Kaushika Uppu*

Exams are a fundamental concept of the educational process in nearly all levels of education, from elementary school to postgraduate studies. Within this framework, numerous factors have the potential to influence student performance, especially in higher education (high school-postgraduate), where students might be facing different situations and stressors. While there are a multitude of potential factors, most can be categorized as being academic, personal, family, or lifestyle.

This dataset encompasses a wide array of variables that might play a role in student exam performance, including those related to academics, family situations, and self-motivation, as well as the response variable—exam score— spanning from high school to post-graduate students. The motivation behind selecting this dataset stems from a curiosity to understand the determinants that could affect students’ academic performance, particularly with regard to their exam outcomes. The central research question that will be addressed in this study is: What are the key factors that influence a student’s performance on exams, and what is the extent of their impact on exam scores?
